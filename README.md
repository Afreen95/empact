Empact provides a variety of mental health services. The main feature is an intelligent, and most importantly, empathetic virtual assistant. While not a substitute for a licensed therapist, Empact is trained to recognize the symptoms of depression. After identifying the symptoms in the user, it suggests a potential diagnosis and recommends actions to take. If the user ever mentions they are in danger of self-harm, Empact immediately asks for a phone number and calls the user. In addition, Empact locates nearby options for mental health treatment, as well as promoting self-care by suggesting healthy practices.
